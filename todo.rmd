ADAPTIVE COMPUTATION
* Task - predict either all points or single point within a certain degree of accuracy.
    * More 'lax' task gives high performance even with less accuracy.
* Write 'kernel complexity' penalizer.
* Weight task performance against complexity; explore the best performing, simplest models

Extension:
*This is a variant of adaptive computation. Instaed of performance, 
 we could also do proper AC and attach relevance to exploring num_particles
 that could change our performance the most.

BENCHMARKING
* Compare traditional particle filter to AC pf to imcmc

Extension 2:
* Multigranularity in the tree itself, although I'm not sure what this looks like.
