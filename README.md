Final Project for Algorithms of the Mind
Witt Phillips and Abi Tenenbaum

Drew heavily from:
Gen tutorials: https://www.gen.dev/tutorials/rj/tutorial#synthesis
Adaptive Computation Codebase: https://github.com/CNCLgithub/AdaptiveComputation

AI tools like Cursor were used to generate code, especially for tasks like plotting and saving data.
